			The Sally Eagle workroom is where every dress	is designed, constructed and
			perfected.
	  </p>
		<p>
			Having her own workroom is a big thing for Sally Eagle.
			It means she knows and maintains the standard to which her dresses are made.
			It also gives her flexibility, so she is able to change a dress to
			ensure it meets her high standards and those of her brides-to-be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sally studied at Massey's design school in Wellington, so she knows how
			hard it is to get construction jobs in Wellington. By keeping production
			in Wellington she is able to give jobs to others in the same situation as
			her, without them having to move or, worse, for the work to go overseas!
