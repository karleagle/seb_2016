	  <p class="large blue">
			Here are our answers to some of the questions you may have.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do I need an appointment to visit?
		</h2>
		<p>
			To ensure you get our full attention we work by appointment only,
			giving each bride&#45;to&#45;be their own one on one consultation.
			Please call or email us to book in your preferred date and time.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are more than welcome to pop by for a quick look through the dresses&#59;
			however if we are in a consultation please keep in mind that
			we may not be able to see you immediately.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			What is the charge for a consultation appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			There is a $30 charge for an initial wedding dress consultation.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			How long does a consultation take?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We book wedding dress consultations in for an hour.
			We find that there is usually time for you to try on up to 8 bridal gowns,
			depending on how long you have each wedding dress on for.
		</p>
		<p>
			We love to spoil our brides and create a nice and relaxing environment
			so we provide light refreshments and nibbles for your visit.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Can I take photos in my appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We do not allow photos during consultations or fittings as we find this can misrepresent how your dress may look on you when finished.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do I need to bring anything to my consultation?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We suggest wearing nude or light coloured underwear and a strapless bra if you have one.
			You are more than welcome to bring shoes of your own to try on with the dresses.
			We also ask that you wear minimal make-up so we are able to keep our dresses looking beautiful for other brides to try on.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Is there parking located nearby?
		</h2>
		<p>
			There is street parking outside the boutique along lower Cuba St and on
			Wakefield street, and a carpark area at the
			<a class="ls_thin link" href="https://en.parkopedia.co.nz/parking/carpark/michael_fowler_centre_car_park/wellington/" target="_blank">Michael Fowler Centre</a> nearby.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			How many people can I bring to an appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our boutique comfortably seats 5 people, including you.
			We suggest only bringing your closest friends or family, those whose opinions you value the most.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Can I skype/facetime in my appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes you are welcome to involve your overseas relatives and friends.
			We understand that they may not be able to make it to your appointment so
			whilst you cannot take photos you can skype or facetime your loved ones.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you have a cancelation policy?
		</h2>
		<p>
			As we work by appointment only, if something has come up and you need to
			cancel or move your appointment we ask that you kindly give us at least 48 hours&#39; notice.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			What is the price range of your dresses?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our wedding dresses range from $2,300&#8211;$4,000
			and our wedding separates (skirts and tops) range from $360&#8211;$1600.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			What sizes are our dress samples in?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We have dresses in our boutique to try on in sizes 6 through to 22.
			As we make all of our dresses in&#45;house we are able to create your dress in any size required.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			How long does it take from when I order a dress to when I receive it?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We require 5 months to make a dress over the peak period (spring/summer)
			and 4 months over the quieter period (autumn/winter).
		</p>
		<p>
			We suggest ordering at least 6 months out from your wedding date.
			However, if you require a shorter timeframe we may be able to make it work.
			Please give us a call or <a class="link blue ls_thin"
	      href="mailto&#58;enquir&#37;69&#37;&#54;&#53;%73&#64;s%61ll%79%&#54;5%61gl&#37;65&#46;%&#54;&#51;o&#46;n%7&#65;?subject=Website%20enquiry">
			email</a> and we can let you know whether we can
			meet your wedding date.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you make custom wedding dresses?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes, we love working with brides to create custom dresses for their special day.
			There is a beautiful range of fabrics and laces to choose from to incorporate
			your unique personality and style into your dress.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you include alterations in the price of your dresses?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Each of our dresses has two prices&#58; a standard size price and a fitted price.
		</p>
		<p>
			All dresses are made by hand at the Wellington boutique, so if you can arrange to
			visit at least three times while we make the dress we will fit it to you
			as part of the dress&#45;making process, which looks the best for any dress.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are not able to make it to the boutique, we will make the dress
			either to your measurements if provided or to your closest standard size.
			Any further alterations required are at your own expense.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you ship internationally?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes we do! We will ship your dress to you wherever you are based around the world.
