    <h1 class="underscore">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>
  </div>
	<div class="left_align padded faq">
	  <p class="large blue">
			Here are the answers to some of the questions you may have.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do I need an appointment to visit?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes we work by appointment only, so please call or email us to book in your preferred date and time.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			What is the charge for a consultation appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			There is a $30 charge for an initial wedding dress consultation and a $15 charge for an initial bridesmaids consultation.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			How long does a consultation take?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We book wedding dress consultations in for an hour and bridesmaids consultations or half an hour.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Can I come without an appointment just to have a look?
		</h2>
		<p>
			You are more than welcome to pop by and visit us; however if we have an appointment at the same time you may not be able to view any dresses, so it is always recommended to book an appointment first.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Can I take photos in my appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We do not allow photos during consultations or fittings as we find this can misrepresent how your dress may look on you when finished.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do I need to bring anything to my consultation?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We suggest wearing nude or light coloured underwear and a strapless bra if you have one.
			You are more than welcome to bring shoes of your own to try on with the dresses.
			We also ask that you wear minimal make-up so we are able to keep our dresses looking beautiful for other brides to try on.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Is there parking located nearby?
		</h2>
		<p>
			There is street parking outside the boutique along lower Cuba St and on Wakefield street, and a carpark area at the <a class="ls_thin link" href="https://en.parkopedia.co.nz/parking/carpark/michael_fowler_centre_car_park/wellington/" target="_blank">Michael Fowler Centre</a> nearby.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			How many people can I bring to an appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our boutique comfortably seats 5 people, including you.
			We suggest only bringing your closest friends or family, those whose opinions you value the most.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Can I skype/facetime in my appointment?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes you are welcome to involve your overseas relatives and friends.
			We understand that they may not be able to make it to your appointment so whilst you cannot take photos you can skype or facetime your loved ones.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you have a cancelation policy?
		</h2>
		<p>
			As we work by appointment only, if something has come up and you need to cancel or move your appointment we ask that you kindly give us at least 48 hours&#39; notice.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			What is the price range of your dresses?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our wedding dresses range from $2000&#8211;$3800
			 and our wedding separates (skirts and tops) range from $360&#8211;$1600.
			Our bridesmaids dresses range from $220&#8211;$550.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			What sizes are our dress samples in?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We have dresses in store to try on in sizes 6 through to 18. Dresses can be ordered for any size required.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			How long does it take from when I order a dress to when I receive it?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We require 5 months to make a dress over the peak period (spring/summer) and 4 months over the quieter period (autumn/winter). We suggest ordering at least 6 months out from your wedding date.
			We can make dresses in a shorter timeframe, which may incur a rush fee. Please give us a call or email and we can let you know whether we can make your deadline.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you make custom wedding dresses?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes we design and make custom wedding dresses.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you include alterations in the price of your dresses?
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you can arrange to visit the Wellington boutique at least three times while we make the dress,
			we can fit your dress to you as part of the dress&#45;making process, free of charge.
			We can also make small design changes to the standard dresses if requested.
			If you are not able to make it to the boutique,
			we will make the dress either to your measurements if provided or to your closest standard size
			and any further alterations required are at your own expense.
	  </p>
		<h2 class="blue">
			Do you ship internationally?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes we do! We will ship your dress to you wherever you are based around the world.
