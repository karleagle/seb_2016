    The Sally Eagle Bridal Boutique is a safe haven for the bride-to-be.
    It is a discreet, private area located on the first floor of 47 Cuba Street in Wellington central.
  </p>
  <p>
		After you are greeted in the welcoming area you will be lead through to the main consultation room.
		The wall on one side of the room holds Sally&#39;s entire range of dresses for you to peruse
		&#8212;elegant wedding dresses, beautiful bridesmaid dresses and adorable flower girl dresses.
		Large windows keep the area feeling open, with natural light amplifying the natural beauty of the dresses.
  </p>
  <p>
		The other end of the boutique has a small change room, couches and a wall mirror.
		There you can show off each beautiful creation to your party as they relax with hot drinks or bubbles and nibbles.
		There is no limit to your entourage but the area comfortably holds a bride-to-be and 4 of her guests,
		so feel free to invite your friends and family to ooh and aah over how you look in each dress until you find the perfect one.
		For more information on the consultation process, see the <a class="thin" href="index.php&#63;view=process">process page</a>.
  </p>
	<p>
		If you are a little early to your consultation feel free to take a seat in the waiting room and have a relaxed look through the wedding magazines available.
		You can sneak a chocolate or two if you like, before heading in to your consultation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Visitors are welcome but we only accommodate one bride-to-be at a time, so if you visit while we are taking a bride through her consultation you will unfortunately be unable to see the dresses.
    Therefore it is recommended that you book ahead, especially if you are looking to try dresses on.
    This ensures that you have the full attention of Ashleigh, Sally&#39;s trusted consultation assistant, as she takes you through a tailored experience to find your perfect wedding dress.
