			Thank you for being one of our lovely stockists! We appreciate the work you do :)
		</p>
		<p>
			We’ve put together a bit of information about our processes and policies so you know what we require and what to expect.
	  </p>
		<div class="subheading">
			<h2 class="blue underscore">
				ORDERING
			</h2>
		</div>
	  <p>
			Wholesale orders are placed by emailing through the order to
				<a class="ls_thin" href="mailto:orders@sallyeagle.co.nz?subject=Stockist%20order">
					orders@sallyeagle.co.nz</a>.
			Provide the following information:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the set size based on our size chart OR the measurements;</li>
			<li>the bride’s name;</li>
			<li>the wedding date;</li>
			<li>the fitting date (or earliest date required).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Once the order is received we will send you a quote with the details of the order for you to confirm by way of 50% deposit.
	  </p>
	  <p>
			We will start construction once the order has been confirmed.
	  </p>
		<div class="subheading">
			<h2 class="blue underscore">
				RECEIVING THE ORDER
			</h2>
		</div>
	  <p>
			When the order is nearing completion we will send an invoice for the remainder of the order, due for payment on the expected sending date.
			Note that this invoice does not cover the cost of any local customs charges and taxes.
			Please make your own enquiries as to any potential additional costs.
		</p>
		<p>
			If there are outstanding amounts from previous invoices unpaid we will contact you to address this.
			To avoid account build-up, if your account balance reaches an unreasonable amount we may withhold further dresses until it is reduced.
	  </p>
		<div class="subheading">
			<h2 class="blue underscore">
				RETENTION OF TITLE (ROMALPA)
			</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			Sally Eagle Bridal Limited retains ownership of all goods supplied until payment has been made in full for the goods.
			The purchaser shall hold goods supplied by Sally Eagle Bridal Ltd in the capacity as fiduciary owner.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">
			<h2 class="blue underscore">
				RUSH ORDERS
			</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			<em>The following applies in our busy season&#8212;between December and February.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			If a dress is required sooner than 12 weeks from the date of the order please contact us and enquire as to whether we can complete the order.
			We are likely to be able to complete it, but we must factor in our production capacity and stock availability before we can accept the order.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we can complete the order by the date required we will confirm our acceptance.
			However if there are any potential issues we will advise you of the situation.
			We will provide options for circumventing any issues and will only decline an order if we cannot overcome the issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may charge a rush order fee at our discretion, which we will notify you of.
		</p>
		<div class="subheading">
			<h2 class="blue underscore">
				RETURNS
			</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			In the situation where a dress arrives damaged or it is not the dress that you ordered you must advise us <b>within 7 days</b> of receiving it.
			If the issue cannot be solved locally (or it is decided that that is not the best option) we will arrange for it to be returned.
			We must be advised of the issue before you take any action.
		</p>
		<p>
			If there is a problem with the dress that could only be discovered during the fitting, such as an incorrect construction, you have another 7 days from the date of the fitting to advise us.
			Note that all dresses are provided as set sizing and some alterations are expected to be required in order to fit the dress to the bride.
